## 1. About
This repository gathers a series of small projects around Satellite Imaging. The main focus is on data analysis and the design of AI algorithms for classification, clustering or forecasting, depending on the purpose of the project. 

The projects are separated into individual directories and mostly coded in Python. Each project comprises a series of annotated notebooks detailing the objectives and explanations for each step of the workflow. Notebooks may be supplemented by Python scripts for instances where code automation is necessary. 

Since data is collected from a variety of sources, a specific folder for the data will be created for every project. In recognition of the work done by the community, and to facilitate access to the data for future efforts, all sources will be acknowledged and source links will be provided when possible. Note, however, that some datasets are processed using multiple data sources. In such cases, the sources shall be disclosed, with varying degrees of detail. Additionally, we reserve the right to disclose the processing code when relevant to the project. It will also be clarified if the used data was artificially produced.

## 2. Requirements
For the correct execution and reproducibility of the notebooks, we recommend the use of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) distribution system.

System requirements are generally basic and in specific cases where GPUs are used, it may be possible to run the project code using either the CPU or on a cloud environment in case the CPU becomes insufficient.

The required libraries are listed at the beginning of each notebook. We also recommend installing [`OpenCV`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), [`Tensorflow`](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/working-with-conda/applications/tensorflow/) and [`Pytorch`](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#windows-installation) libraries.

It is advisable to check for compatibility between certain versions of the libraries used in each project, with particular attention to numpy, matplotlib and tensorflow.

## 3. Project Status
1. Cropland Estimation:
    - Scripts have been completed.
    - The annotated notebook for image classification is now 100% complete.
    - The work on the annotated notebook for image segmentation is now 100% complete.
    - A third notebook presenting a real world example is now 100% complete.

2. TBD
